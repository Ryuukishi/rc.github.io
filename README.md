## Purpose

The purpose of this website is to provide a platform for me to display relevant information about myself to anyone who visits my site — whether that be prospective employers, coworkers, friends and family or people who are just interested about me or what I do. The portfolio should inform the user about my work history, skills and also more personal information information such as hobbies and background. I can use this website to showcase and highlight projects I've been a part of and relevant skills/work experience that would help me in landing a job.

## Target Audience





## Tech Stack

The website is written entirely in HTML/CSS although some 3rd-party resources are used including:

- Google Fonts - Quicksand Font
- Font Awesome Icon Library - used for the SNS/contact info icons located at the bottom of the homepage

The entire website is hosted on GitHub pages which is ideal since I can push any commits to my GitHub repo and the website will be updated with those changes in a matter of seconds. Each HTML page has been validated using the W3C Validator to ensure the pages are error-free.
